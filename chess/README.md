Perusing through those blog posts it seems as though one of the assignments
early on is a chess program.

So this is my take at coding chess in ruby.


Plan is to first implement some sort of generic model that enforces the rules
of chess. Then I plan on reading some of those posts or code in more detail
for ideas on how I might want to implement the frontend.
