App Academy Stuff
=================

AA doesn't start for me until August 2014, but being the eager beaver that I
am, I've decided to hunt the web for some preview material.

Turns out, many past and current students blog about their experience with
their studies as well as post their code to github. With the Internet as my
guide, and this github repo as my scratchpad, I set out to learn some stuff.


Some of the blogs I'm looking at for reference:
